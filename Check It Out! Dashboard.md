# Check It Out! Dashboard

The following dashboard (static preview and interactive link below) was created as the final deliverable of a graduate-level data visualization class. The data was generated by the Seattle Public Library and  is contained in the following links: [Monthly Checkouts by Title](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6), [Library Collection Inventory](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Library-Collection-Inventory/6vkj-f5xf), [Library Locations](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Seattle-Public-Libraries/id7u-w2mt), [Physical Checkouts by Title](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-By-Title-Physical-Items-/5src-czff), and [Data Dictionary](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Integrated-Library-System-ILS-Data-Dictionary/pbt3-ytbc). Our team performed data combinations and cleaning, as well as dashboard design and development.
